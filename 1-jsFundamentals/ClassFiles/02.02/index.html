        <h1>What helps me?</h1>
        <h3><a href= "https://www.google.com/" target= "blank"></a>Google!!!!</h3>
        <p> Google is an awesome tool, if I can't remember what I need for my code I can find it using Google!</p>
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>Website support technichian helped me learn a lot about HTML and CSS, a lot of things I didn't know when I started that position, being able to still access our 
            our templates and test websites is great place to find things.

        <h1>Where do I struggle?</h1>
        <h3>Remembering it all</h3>
        <p>Trying to remember everything when I sit down to do a challenge or work, yes I know I can look it up but I tend to beat myself up over not Remembering
            what I think I should remember.
        </p>
        <h3>Second guessing myself</h3>
        <p>I second guess myself in everything, so it makes it difficult when learning code especially because I think I did something wrong when its right and I 
            keep changing things that don't need changed and then just frustrate myself.
